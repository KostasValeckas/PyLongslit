# Summary

We present a new Python pipeline for processing data from astronomical 
long-slit spectroscopy observations with CCD detectors.

The pipeine is designed to aim for **simplicity**, **manual execution**, **transparency** and **robustness**. The inspiration for the pipeline is to provide a manual and simple counterpart to the 
well-established semi-automated and automated pipelines. The intented use-cases are **teaching** and **edge-case observations**, where 
automated pipelines fail due to very low signal-to-noise ratio, several objects being very close 
on the detector and alike. For further elaboration,
please see the [Statement of need](#statement-of-need). 

From raw data, the
pipeline can produce the following output:

- A calibrated 2D spectrum in counts and wavelength for every detector pixel.
- A 1D spectrum extracted from the 2D spectrum in counts per wavelength (for point-like objects).
- A flux-calibrated 1D spectrum in $\frac{\text{erg}}{\text{s} \cdot \text{cm}^2 \cdot \text{Ã…}}$ (for point-like objects).


The products are obtained by performing standard procedures for
detector calibrations [@handbook] [@Howell_2006], comsic-ray subtraction [@cr_1] [@cr_2]
, and 1D spectrum extraction [@Horne_1986] [@photutils].   

# Statement of need

A natural approach when developing data-precessing pipelines is to seek for precision and automation. The trade-off for this 
is code complexity and "black-box" solutions, where the process of the pipeline is often masked, and 
the quality-assesment output is made under the assumtpiton that the user knows how to interpret it. 
In research, this is a reasonable trade-off, as a certain level of user-skill and experience can be assumed. However, 
in a teaching paradigm, simplicity and transparency are often more favorable, even when this means loss of 
precision and automation. The PyLongslit pipeline is designed to rely on simple code and manual execution,
supported by a large array of quality-assesment plots and extensive documentation. The algortihms are designed to produce research-quality results, yet while prioritizing simplicity over high precission. The reason for this is 
to create a robust and transparent pipeline, where every step of the execution is visualized and explained. We see this as being specially valuable in teaching scenarios and for users that 
are new to spectroscopic data processing. Furthermore, we hope that 
the simple coding style will invite users of all skill-levels to contribute to the code.

An early beta-version of the software was user-tested during the Nordic Optical Telescope[^1] IDA summer-course 
2024[^2], where all student groups where able to follow the documentation and succesfully process data 
without any significant assistance. 

During the developtment of software it became apparent that the manual nature of the pipeline is 
also useful for observations where automated pipelines might fail. The PyLongslit pipeline can revert to manual methods instead of using mathematical modelling when estimating the observed object trace on the 
detector. This is specially useful for objects
that have low signal-to-noise ratio, or where several objects are very close to each onther on the detector.

# Pipeline

The figure below shows an overview of the pipeline structure. In a broad sense, there
are three stages of the data processing. The first stage is to process all raw data 
to obtain calibrated 2d spectra. Then, the calibrated spectra can be processed further 
by employing cosmic-ray removal, cropping of spectrum and sky-background subtraction.
The third stage is extracting the 1d spectra from the 2d spectra, flux calibrating the 
extracted products and combinning the spectra (if several observations of same object are present).

All the diamond shapes in the figure represent different pipeline routines that 
are called directly from the command line.

The pipeline is controlled by a configuration file that has to be passed as an 
argument to every pipeline procedure. The different parameters of the configuration 
file are descriped in the documentation.

# Evaluation and Limitations

To test the pipeline for correctness, we run the pipeline on data from 2 
instruments: NOT ALFOSC[^3] and GTC OSIRIS[^4], and compare the results with the results from a well-established, 
semi-automated PypeIt Python pipeline  [@pypeit:joss_pub] [@pypeit:joss_arXiv] [@pypeit:zenodo].

![GTC OSIRIS observation of GQ1218+0823.\label{fig:gtc}](gtc_comp.png)

![NOT ALFOSC observation of SDSS_J213510+2728.\label{fig:alfosc}](alfosc_comp.png)

We see good agreement between results from PyLongslit and PypeIt, indicating 
evidence for correctness.

As mentioned in the [Statement of need](#statement-of-need), the pipeline favors
simplicity over high precission. Furthermore, the pipeline is designed to be 
**instrument independent**. Due to these design choices, the pipeline might be 
less precise than pipelines that are instrument-dependent.
