# Summary

We present a new manual Python pipeline for processing data from  astronomical 
long-slit spectroscopy observations with CCD detectors.

The pipeine is designed to aim for **simplicity**, **manual execution**, **transparency** and **robustness**. The inspiration for the pipeline is to provide a manual counterpart to the 
well-established semi-automated and aumated pipelines. The intented use-cases are **teaching** and **edge-case observations**, where 
automated pipelines fail due to very low signal-to-noise ratio, several objects being very close 
on the detector and alike. For further elaboration,
please see the [Statement of need](#statement-of-need). 

From raw data, the
pipeline can produce the following output:
- A calibrated 2D spectrum in counts and wavelength for every detector pixel.
- A 1D spectrum extracted from the 2D spectrum in counts per wavelength (for point-like objects).
- A flux-calibrated 1D spectrum in $\frac{\text{erg}}{\text{s} \cdot \text{cm}^2 \cdot \text{Ã…}}$ (for point-like objects).


The products are obtained by performing standard procedures for
detector calibrations [@handbook] [@Howell_2006], comsic-ray subtraction [@cr_1] [@cr_2]
, and 1D spectrum extraction [@Horne_1986] [@photutils].
