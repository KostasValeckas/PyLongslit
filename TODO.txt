* implement clutch spectrum from earlier version
* Overscan check will need flats at bias levels - make overscan check active only in check_config.py
* Give flats an extra look about normalization area - maybe consult an expert
* Logger just keeps dumping to same file - move logger to output_dir, make logger adaptable to different levels or verbosity
* Fit initiation should be moved to utils - for now too much repeated code.
* make object FWHM different for sky and object tracing, or for standard star and science parts
* go through all imports
* for writing results to dat files - make a util

* clean up it wavecalib

* Develop combine and transform at the very end

NICE-TO-HAVE for the future:
* Interpolation function used now is being depricated - look into swapping it out.
* Animated plots in the fitting processes
* When utils get too inflated, chop up into several models (fitting, plotting, utils) or alike.
* the filelist object in utils could use a refactor - specially in combinning with open_fits method
* most data loading code assume that the raw data will be in hdul[1].data - make this more robust
* it should be possible to implement automatic rotation curve detection with current tilt tracing
