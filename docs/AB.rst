A-B Background subtraction
==========================

.. note:: 
    This procedure can only be performed if you have several frames of the same object,
    taken continuously one after another, with the same exposure time, but where the 
    objects' spatial position is with purpose shifted slightly on the detector. **Skip this procedure if you do not have
    such frames.**
