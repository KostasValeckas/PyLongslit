Getting started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As for now, PyLongslit is a work in progress and the execution of the software 
is highly manual. The software depends on "hard-coded" paths and file names,
often relative to the location of the script.

We therefore believe that the best way to learn how the software works
is by following a tutorial. The tutorial will guide you through the reduction
of a long-slit spectrum, and will also comment on where changes should be 
made when/if you will run the software for your own data/setup.

The example data comes from 
`ALFOSC <https://www.not.iac.es/instruments/alfosc/>`_ , and is an 
observation of SDSSJ234034-033205 quasar, provided by
Johan Peter Uldall Fynbo.
