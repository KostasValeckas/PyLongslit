Getting started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Execution of the software is highly manual, and therefore the first time 
using it can be a bit overwhelming. The software is designed to be
simple, but it is also designed to be flexible. This means that there are
many parameters that can be set to match your data and setup. 

We provide 2 tutorial datasets that have all the prameters pre-set, so that
you can run the software without having to change anything to get a feel
for how it works.
